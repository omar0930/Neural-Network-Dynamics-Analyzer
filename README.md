# Neural Network Dynamics Analyzer

## Overview
The **Neural Network Dynamics Analyzer** is a tool designed to analyze the internal behavior of neural networks. It provides insights into weight updates, activation patterns, and gradient flow during training.

## Features
- Tracks weight changes over epochs
- Visualizes neuron activations
- Analyzes gradient distributions
- Supports multiple neural network architectures
- Customizable visualization options

## Installation
Clone the repository using:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/omar0930/Neural-Network-Dynamics-Analyzer.git
cd Neural-Network-Dynamics-Analyzer
```

## Dataset
The tool is model-agnostic and can be used with any dataset. Users can specify their own datasets for training and analysis.

## Workflow
1. Load and train a neural network model.
2. Monitor weight updates and gradient flow.
3. Visualize neuron activations across layers.
4. Analyze performance metrics over training epochs.
5. Fine-tune hyperparameters based on insights.

## Results
The tool provides detailed visualizations, including:
- **Weight change maps**: Displaying how weights evolve over training.
- **Activation heatmaps**: Showing neuron activity for different layers.
- **Gradient distribution plots**: Helping detect vanishing or exploding gradients.
- **Training performance graphs**: Tracking loss and accuracy trends.

These insights help optimize neural network performance and improve training stability.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- TensorFlow/Keras
- PyTorch
- Matplotlib & Seaborn (for visualization)
- NumPy & Pandas
